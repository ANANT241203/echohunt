Project Name: EchoHunt
Tagline: An AI-powered AR scavenger hunt using Gemini 3 vision.

Description:
EchoHunt is a zero-install, mobile-first web game that turns the real world into a playground. Using the Gemini 3 API, the app analyzes live camera frames to verify if the user has found the scavenger hunt items (e.g., "Find something red", "Find a reflective surface"). It features a custom AR-style overlay, Web Speech API integration for immersive audio feedback, and an "Auto Scan" mode powered by the low-latency capabilities of Gemini 3 Flash.

How we used Gemini:
- Model: gemini-3-flash-preview (default), gemini-3-pro-preview (optional).
- Vision: Analyzes user-captured video frames.
- Structured Data: Uses Gemini's JSON schema enforcement to control game state (searching vs success), confidence scores, and dynamic hints.
- Latency: Optimized using low thinking budget configurations for real-time game feel.

Tech Stack:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai)
- Vercel (Hosting)

Instructions:
1. Open the URL on a mobile device.
